# 2D_Task_Umut
 2d challenge project with Stardew Valley style

# Overview of the Game System
This project is a 2D game I built using Unity. It involves some exploring, fighting, and solving puzzles. Players can grow their characters, chat with NPCs, and face off against enemies.

# Development Thoughts and Process
I started by setting clear goals to keep my work organized. Using Unity, I put together the basic gameplay elements like moving around, picking up items, and a health system. I wanted the combat to feel good and be fun, so I put extra effort into that.

I designed the game so it can be easily updated or expanded. The code is organized to keep things separate and straightforward, which helps a lot with making changes later on.
