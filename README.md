# 2D_Task_Umut
 2d challenge project with Stardew Valley style

# Overview of the Game System
This project is a 2D game I built using Unity. It involves some exploring, fighting, and solving puzzles. Players can grow their characters, chat with NPCs, and face off against enemies.

# Development Thoughts and Process
I started by setting clear goals to keep my work organized. Using Unity, I put together the basic gameplay elements like moving around, picking up items, and a health system. I wanted the combat to feel good and be fun, so I put extra effort into that.

I designed the game so it can be easily updated or expanded. The code is organized to keep things separate and straightforward, which helps a lot with making changes later on.

Actually there are still some minor bugs and but main required functionality seems working so I wanted to upload it. 

I will update later implement better features in the upcoming days.

Required features: 
1. Shopkeeper interaction
 2. Buying/selling items
 3. Item icons
 4. Item prices
 5. Ability to equip purchased outfits, visible on the character

    These features seems to be working although not the best ui design but due to major bugs and bigger project size, this state should be ok for now. Bear in mind that code compile takes 50 sec and unity completing domain also takes additional 1 min so playtesting was very hard like only every 2 3 mins.

    Additional challenges were sprite animations , animation layers and some ui designs.
